<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br>
<span class="fs80">A SAIL.</span></h2>

<p>A fine large steamboat was
sailing up the Hudson river
one summer morning.</p>

<p>Up and down its broad decks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
and pretty saloons skipped lively
little Julia Cary.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me to keep still,
Ellen; I can’t, I am so happy,”
she said.</p>

<p>Ellen was her nurse, who had
taken loving care of Julia since
she was a baby.</p>

<p>She kindly went to the side
of the boat, whenever it was to
land, so that the little girl might
see a stout man ring a big bell,
and other men throw ropes to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
men on shore. These ran and
threw the ropes over huge posts,
and so held the boat fast till
people went ashore. Then other
people came on the boat; then
the ropes were drawn back, and
the boat started on again.</p>

<p>But Julia liked better still to
wander about, holding her father’s
hand. He could answer
all her questions about the
lovely shores they sailed between.
He told the names of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the villages they passed, and
showed her the busy machinery
that sent the boat swiftly along,
far away from the hot city.</p>

<p>“Papa,” said Julia, “are you
poor?”</p>

<p>“In money, child? No, no;
I have more than you and I
will spend.”</p>

<p>“And you are good, papa,
and are not sick. What did
that lady mean when she said,
‘Poor Julia! poor papa!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Cary walked quickly on,
leading Julia by the hand.</p>

<p>Down stairs, where trunks
and boxes of all kinds were
piled, on their own poor luggage
sat a family of German
emigrants.</p>

<p>You would quickly call them
poor. Their clothes were coarse.
They were eating black bread,
because they could not pay for
a good dinner such as Julia
and her father had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Two little girls and one stout
boy laughed and jabbered their
queer talk with their mother
and father. The mother held
a baby on her knee—an odd-looking
fat baby, with a funny
cap on its head.</p>

<p>Mr. Cary sat down on a
trunk, at a little distance from
them, and lifting Julia upon
his knee, he said,</p>

<p>“My darling will learn that
she and I must be, in one way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
poor as long as we live. What
has that little trot-foot got that
money cannot buy for my Julia?”</p>

<p>Julia looked at the shiny,
apple-cheeked little Dutch girl
who came shyly towards her.
She noticed the thin dress, the
heavy shoes, the ugly net over
her yellow hair. Surely, Julia
bought for herself lovelier
things than those.</p>

<p>Julia kept thinking. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
strange child too was thinking,
and drew so near that she was
scared at last to find herself so
far from her mother. She
turned and ran back. The
mother held out her arm, hugged
the little girl close to her
heart, and kissed her between
her blue eyes.</p>

<p>That kiss told Julia what her
father meant. Laying her head
upon his shoulder, she said, “I
know, papa; she has her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
dear mother. But mine—<em>O
papa!</em>”</p>

<p>Julia’s tears choked back the
words that might have told you
her dear mother was in heaven.</p>

<p>Sitting there, Julia and her
father felt how very poor she
was in losing mother-love and
care and kisses, like that which
blessed those little strangers.
The Germans had no house, no
land—had only money enough
to take them West, where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
must work hard all day, early
and late. But they had <em>each
other</em>.</p>

<p>They might tell us that life
and love are God’s best blessings.
Health and wealth are
also his rich gifts, but not so
dear—oh no! oh no!</p>

<span class="fs80">A RIDE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>At Catskill Mr. Cary and
Julia left the boat; and Ellen,
too, with her hands full of baskets,
bags, and wraps.</p>

<p>They walked aside from the
crowd on the dock, towards a
man who was holding the reins
of two bright bay horses.</p>

<p>This was uncle Benjamin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
He had left his hay-field, ten
miles away, and come down to
the river to welcome our travellers.
Smiles and black eyes
lit up his sunburnt face cheerily.</p>

<p>If you had been looking off
from the boat to see Julia go
ashore, you would have wished
you too might have been lifted
by his strong arms into his
easy carriage.</p>

<p>Ellen and the baskets were
next put in. Mr. Cary sprang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
to the front seat, and uncle Benjamin
got up beside him.</p>

<p>The horses started as if they
were in a hurry to get through
the bars of their green pasture-lot
again. Away they went
over the hills.</p>

<p>Julia thought there was no
other man so good as uncle
Benjamin. She thought he
owned all that country, that all
the calves and colts scampering
about the farms they passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
belonged to him, and many an
eager question she asked about
what she saw.</p>

<p>“O uncle Benjamin!” she
shouted at last, so quickly that
he half stopped his horses, as
he turned to hear, “have you
got any kittens for me?”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” he laughed; “I
thought you had dropped your
hat or bag in the road. Got
any kittens? Can’t say. Charley
or Johnny will know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>A few more hills were crossed,
and uncle Benjamin was at
home.</p>

<p>Aunt Abby stood smiling at
the open door; but the boys
met the carriage at the gate.
They were in haste to see this
dear little cousin who came but
once a year.</p>

<p>Before Mr. Cary had hung
up his dusty linen coat, Julia
whispered,</p>

<p>“Papa, they <em>have</em> got kittens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
four of them. Please ask if I
may have one for my own
self.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cary told aunt Abby
how lonely Julia was at home
without her mother; how for
weeks her heart had been so
sad she could hardly play at
all. She was getting used to
the stillness in the house, and
the heartache was wearing
away. But she wanted some
<em>live</em> thing to play with, she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
and hoped to take home a <em>real</em>
kitten.</p>

<p>“Poor little motherless girl!”
sighed aunt Abby.</p>

<p>When called to tea, Julia
came in smiling, with Charley
and Johnny, who had been
showing her their out-door
pets.</p>

<p>After tea, Julia led her father
to the old woodhouse stairway,
where there was a more lowly
kind of mother-love to be seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>A large contented-looking
cat lay on the door-step, winking
fearlessly at them. The
cunningest of four kittens was
climbing on her back. Two
prettier kittens were having a
frolic at her feet, while the other
one sat soberly looking on.
Sometimes the wild ones rolled
over and over each other down
the steps.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see such lovely,
pesshus kittens, papa dear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“None so precious to you
and this mother-cat,” her papa
said, smiling to see her so
pleased.</p>

<p>“And I can have one! All the
folks say so. Now help me
find out, papa, which is the
bestest kitty.”</p>

<p>“I wish a mouse would come
along; then I’d tell you which
<em>I</em> think is the best,” said Charley.</p>

<p>“But I don’t care ’bout my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
kitty’s catching mice; I only
want her to play with me. She
shall have milk to drink, and
part of my dinner every day.”</p>

<p>“Kittens would look prettier
to me if I didn’t know they
would grow to be cats,” Johnny
said.</p>
<br>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image027.jpg" alt="One cat">

<br>

<p>“Bah! yes!” said Charley.
“Up on that shed, by your bedroom
window—see, Julia—see
that big striped cat! Johnny
and I just loved him when he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>was a kitten. But he kills our
birds, and that we can’t forgive.”</p>

<p>Up spoke kind-hearted Johnny:
“I b’lieve he’s the wickedest,
badest cat that meows. So
many nests he has spoiled!
Then the mother-birds cry and
call so, we have to stop our
ears. When I get a gun, I
b’lieve I’ll shoot you, Mr. Tom.”</p>

<p>Johnny handled a willow-rod
as if it were a gun, and pointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
it up at the big gray cat. But
it did not fear him, it was up
so high. Perhaps it knew
nothing about guns.</p>

<p>“Better go to bed now, Julia.
Dream about the kittens, and
in the morning we will see
which one we like the best.”</p>
<br>

<span class="fs80">CHOOSING THE KITTEN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the morning two little
girls, Anne and Rose, from the
next farmhouse, came to ask
for a kitten.</p>

<p>Aunt Abby said Julia must
first choose her own.</p>

<p>The liveliest kitty had a
black-and-white coat, with black
cap and ears. Its clean white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
face and hands and feet pleased
Julia so well, that she tied her
red ribbon around its neck.</p>

<p>Anne and Rose were just as
content with the gray ones the
boys gave to them.</p>

<p>When they went away, each
carried a kitten in her arms,
and each very sweetly asked
Julia to come to see them.</p>

<p>“We will,” said aunt Abby,
“to see how the kittens like
their new home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“Come here, Papa Cary,” this
kind aunt said after breakfast,
when he sat under the cherry-tree
reading his newspaper;
“come to my kitchen-door and
see a pretty picture.”</p>

<p>Papa went with her, and saw
his Julia trying to make the
kitten love her.</p>

<p>She had a basin of new milk,
of which kitty had been drinking.
Now it was purring its
thanks. Julia laid her fat cheek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
against its furry side to hear
the purr-purring sound.</p>

<p>“Dear little kitty, you will
love me, wont you? My dollies
just lie still, and can’t love
a bit. You nice, warm, live
kitty, you wont let me be lonesome
any more.”</p>
<br>

</div>

<p>So now there were only two
kittens in aunt Abby’s house.</p>

<p>Julia found them in mischief
that very day, up on the kitchen
table.</p>

<p>Aunt Abby was getting ready
to make a custard. She had
gone to the pantry for some
eggs, and had left the milk on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
the table, and the sugar-jar uncovered.
When she stepped
out of the kitchen, the kittens
stepped in. The flies, perhaps,
had been in before.</p>

<p>No little boy or girl would
meddle with sugar or milk left
in the way; but it is hard to
teach kittens that it is wrong
to touch what is not theirs.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>When aunt Abby and Julia
came back with the eggs, the
flies were stealing the sugar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>and the kittens were lapping
the milk from the pan.</p>

<p>I wonder if those kittens told
their mother that Ellen
gave each of them a rap on the
ear.</p>

</div>

<p>One morning Mr. Cary and
uncle Benjamin started for a
long day’s ride.</p>

<p>When her papa kissed Julia
good-by, tears came in her eyes.</p>

<p>“My heartache will come
back again,” she said.</p>

<p>But work is a good thing for
a sad heart, and aunt Abby had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
plenty of that for Julia. There
were a hundred babies in feathers,
out of doors, which Julia
liked to feed. For breakfast,
dinner, and supper, and for
lunches between, Julia carried
them food in a tin pail.</p>

<p>There were turkeys, chickens,
and ducks.</p>

<p>When they saw aunty and
Julia and the tin pail coming,
they knew they should be fed.
So out of the coops came chickens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
and turkeys, peeping and
chirping like little birds. And
up from the little pond waddled
the tiny ducks. It was fun to
see how fast they came; how
they tumbled down and hopped
over one another in a hungry
scrabble.</p>

<p>Aunt Abby thought Julia
would not miss her dear father
so much if she were with Anne
and Rose. So after dinner they
went to visit them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>The little girls had but few
playthings, but the kitten made
fun enough for them. Anne
had already taught her puss to
play with a string.</p>

<p>Before tea was quite ready
for the grown folks, Anne and
Rose took a box of very small
dishes out on the grass, and set
a table of their own. Their
mamma gave them a part of
each dish she had for her own
guest, which made a nice feast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>They laughed and ate a great
deal, and drank a great many
cups of tea. But as the most
of their tea came out of the
milk-pitcher, and the rest from
the teakettle, it did not keep
either of them awake that night.</p>

<p>They had romped so hard,
that soon after tea aunt Abby
thought best for Julia to say
“Good-night,” and each of the
little tea-drinkers was soon
asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>Julia told her papa the next
day about her good visit, and
said she chased those same
kittens all night. Aunt Abby
said that was because she had
been so wild, and had got so
tired.</p>

<span class="fs80">JULIA AND PUSSY GO HOME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One morning Julia was riding
with her uncle, when they
passed Anne and Rose on their
way to school. Anne’s kitten
had followed them so slyly, it
was not seen till they were near
the schoolhouse door.</p>

<p>Uncle Benjamin bade them
teach the puss its <span class="allsmcap">A-B-C</span>s.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image051" style="max-width: 58.4375em;">

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“Good-by!” said Julia. “I
am going home to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Anne and Rose were sorry
they could not see this dear little
friend again.</p>

<p>The next morning, when Julia
awoke, Ellen had the bags
and baskets ready to take home
again. No, not quite ready, for
one basket was to hold the kitten,
and Ellen called Julia to
get up and catch it, to be in
time for their journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>Kitty seemed to know they
wanted to take her away from
her mother and sister pussy,
and she tried to keep out of
their way.</p>

<p>But Charley and Johnny were
as cunning as she, and caught
her at last.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image055" style="max-width: 56.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image055.jpg" alt="Cat chasing mouse">
</figure>
<br>

<p>Ellen said puss had gone in
the pantry. Charley peeped in,
but did not see her. He heard
a stir of the paper on the shelf,
and stood still at the door. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>saw a mouse leap off the shelf,
and before he could hit it with
his cap, it had run into a hole
in the floor, and got out of the
way of boy and kitten; for kitty
jumped from behind the
flour-barrel where she had hid,
and Charley caught her.</p>

<p>Johnny held the basket while
Charley put her in it. Then
Ellen tied the cover down. Julia
had put in that basket some
bits of meat for kitty’s lunch;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
and in another she had a bottle
of milk and Johnny’s old tin
cup, to give puss a drink while
on the boat.</p>

<p>But before the carriage was
out of the lane, the kitten was
out of the basket, and everybody
saw her wildly running
back to the woods.</p>

<p>“My kitty! O my kitty! I
can never go without her!”
cried Julia.</p>

<p>“Here, Johnny!” shouted uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Benjamin, as he turned his
horses round, “you and Charley
scamper after that kitten.”</p>

<p>The boys leaped over the
stone wall.</p>

<p>“But this will make us late
for the boat,” said Mr. Cary.</p>

<p>“Wont the cars do as well?
I can’t bear to let the little girl
go without the kitten that was
so ‘pesshus.’”</p>

<p>They drove back to the shade
of the willow-tree by the gate.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Aunt Abby had stood there
watching them. She said if
kitty did not come back soon,
they must wait for her and take
to-morrow’s boat. But then
they heard the boys shout, and
soon the funny fellows came
out of the woods with the runaway.</p>

<p>Papa Cary tied the cover this
time, and puss was surely fast.</p>

<p>Again the loving good-bys
were said under the old willow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
and Julia could not tell if she
were most glad or sorry to start
for home.</p>

<p>Kitty did not get overboard.
She drank a cup of city milk—poor
thing!—at bed time, beside
the bed Julia and Ellen
made for her in the storeroom,
where, cook said, there were
plenty of mice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br>
<span class="fs80">AT HOME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Julia loved the kitten, and
the kitten loved Julia. Once
more the halls rang with the
little girl’s merry laugh.</p>

<p>Puss learned some smart
tricks.</p>

<p>Mr. Cary showed Julia how
she might teach the kitten to
jump through her arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>Clasping her little hands, and
holding her arms out like a
hoop, she would kneel on the
floor. Puss would step over
her hands, held so low. Then
Julia held her arms up a little;
and soon the kitten could hop
through this pretty hoop. By-and-by
Julia could stand up,
and the kitty would come when
she called “Puss! puss!” and
jump through her arms, which
was a pretty sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Ellen, too, grew fond of puss,
and was very kind to her. She
would play with Ellen’s spools
of thread, and roll about her
ball of mending-cotton, while
the good nurse sat sewing with
Julia beside her.</p>

<p>So this simple kitten, one of
the humblest of God’s creatures,
helped to make poor motherless
Julia a happy child.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>
<div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

status with the IRS.
</div>
<div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>
<div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
<div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>
<div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
